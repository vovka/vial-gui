# Vial GUI Fork

## Original README

See [README.md](/README.md) for the upstream overview, release links, and development setup.

## What This Fork Changes

This fork focuses on making tap dance and macro behavior visible directly in the GUI so key assignments are easier to understand at a glance.

- Tap dance key labels now preview actions using dot/underscore notation.
- Keymap rendering shows the tap dance header centered with action lines aligned for readability.
- Tap dance labels update reliably across the UI when entries are changed.
- Tap dance fonts are scaled down for dense labels without shrinking the keycode button grid.
- Macro key labels now preview text content and refresh after saving macros.
- Macro labels use smaller fonts for multi-line previews without changing button sizing.
