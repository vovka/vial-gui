# Vial GUI Fork

## Original README

See [README.md](/README.md) for the upstream overview, release links, and development setup.

## What This Fork Changes

This fork focuses on making tap dance and macro behavior visible directly in the GUI so key assignments are easier to understand at a glance.

- Tap dance: key labels preview dot/underscore actions; header/action lines align for readability; labels refresh after edits; font sizing stays compact without shrinking the grid.
- Macros: labels preview text content and key actions; refresh after saving; smaller fonts for multi-line previews without changing button sizing.
- Keymap rendering: combo overlays for chorded inputs; masked key labels expand to show inner keycodes.
